Chocolate is a tiny library for self update in iOS wireless app distribution
environment. It is useful when you want to distribute test apps or in-house apps
in enterprise developement for iPhone and iPad.

Chocolate doesn't need any application server. All you need is a web server
and then you just put a manifest file and .ipa file on the web server.
